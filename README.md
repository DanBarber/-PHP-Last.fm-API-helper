# -PHP-Last.fm-API-helper v0.1...
Simple PHP helper which allows me to access data from the Last.fm API and display this on my site.

Feel free to use this if you wish for simple gathering of Last.fm data, however it is basic and has no error handling.

lastfm_config.php file needs to be edited to include your Last.fm username and API key which can be created at http://www.last.fm/api/account/create and then it should start grabbing your own Last.fm data!
